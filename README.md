![][screencast]


## Download ##

Get this Stash workflow for Alfred from [GitHub][gh-releases] or [Packal][packal-page]. See 
this [guide][alfred-workflow-installation] on how to install a workflow in Alfred (basically, you 
just have to open the file by double-clicking on it).


## Configuration ##

You have to configure the parameters for connecting to your Stash instance. Use the following command:

- `stash:config` â€” Configure the Stash host URL, and if necessary, a username and password


## Usage ##

Start typing `stash` in Alfred and you will be guided by a menu.

Please note that you can `CMD+C` a repository entry to get its clone URL.


## Icons ##

After a repository name you might sometimes see the following icons:

| Icon |                    Description                    |
|------|---------------------------------------------------|
|  â‘‚   | Repository is a fork                              |
|  ðŸ”“   | Public repository                                 |
